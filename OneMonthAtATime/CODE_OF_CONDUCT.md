# Code of conduct

# TL;DR #
Be nice to each other :)

We want an open and respectful community at Fungus. So we would ask you when communicating (for example, posting on our Forums, Comments or github repository ) to be friendly and helpful. We find, for most people, this is not a problem. Our list of guidelines below is not exhaustive but should give a strong indication of what we consider acceptable community behaviour.

# Be welcoming #
We welcome and support people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.

# Be respectful #
It's ok to disagree with someone. It's not ok to personally attack someone. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.

Bullying or Harassment will not be tolerated
The following behaviours are not acceptable:

- Violent threats or language directed against another person.
- Sexist, racist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
- Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
- Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
- Sharing private content, such as emails sent privately or non-publicly, or unlogged forums such as IRC channel history.
- Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
- Unwelcome sexual attention.
- Excessive or unnecessary profanity.
- Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour.

# Assume Good Intentions #
Give people the benefit of the doubt. If you believe they have acted against the code of conduct, please refer them to this document. Remember, although English is the primary language of Fungus development, that not all members have English as their primary language.
